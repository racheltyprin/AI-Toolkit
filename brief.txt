Virtual AI Prototyping Cart – Build Brief (2-Pager)

Purpose & Vision
Design and build a curated 'Virtual AI Prototyping Cart' that enables non-technical students to rapidly
transform ideas into tangible prototypes using AI tools. This resource should function like a digital toolkit
— practical, beginner-friendly, cost-aware, and immediately usable in a studio setting.

Core Components
• Landing Page Overview: Curate 10–20 high-quality AI tools grouped by function (No-Code Apps,
UI/UX Design, AI Coding Assistants, Content/Visual Generation, Automation, Research/Validation).
Include: short description, best use case, ideal user, pricing tier, and free/student credit details.
• Tool Detail Pages: Each selected tool must include a 5–10 minute quick-start tutorial, step-by-step
instructions, one concrete example project, common mistakes, and when NOT to use the tool.
• Cost Optimization Guide: Clear breakdown of free tiers, student discounts, startup credits, and
approximate monthly costs. Include a recommended zero-budget stack.
• Sample Workflows (3): Non-technical MVP builder, research-to-product demo creator, AI-enhanced
design prototype. Each must include tool stack, time estimate, and cost estimate.

Quality Bar & Constraints
• Assume beginner-level technical knowledge.
• Time-to-first-prototype under 30 minutes.
• At least one fully free workflow.
• Total recommended cost under $25/month where possible.
• Prioritize stable tools with strong documentation.
• Practical and realistic — no hype.

Execution Guidelines
• Curate a robust but thoughtful set of 10–20 tools across categories.
• Each tutorial must be testable end-to-end by a beginner without outside research.
• Include screenshots or workflow diagrams (to be added during build phase).
• Highlight trade-offs between tools so students learn decision-making, not just clicking steps.
• Provide clear pathways from prototype → user testing → iteration.

Deliverable Format
The final Virtual AI Prototyping Cart should be delivered as a clean, navigable digital resource that
functions like a curated toolbox where students can quickly browse tools, click into a guide, and build
something tangible in a single session.

Success Criteria
• Students can independently produce an app mockup, interactive demo, landing page, or
AI-generated artifact within one class session.
• Students understand which tools to use for which problem.
• Students leave with confidence in using AI as a prototyping accelerator.
• Resource reduces overwhelm while expanding capability.

End Goal
This is not just a tool list. It is a structured, execution-ready prototyping system that empowers students
to move from idea to artifact rapidly and confidently.
